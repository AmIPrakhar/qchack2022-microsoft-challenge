## Pulse Programming Quantum Computers

A pulse is a time series of complex numbers, with a maximum unit norm. 

Using pulses we created a quantum gate that cannot be decomposed any further using fundamental gates. The gate we created is a cross resonance gate. 
Pulse programming is useful because it characterizes quantum devices and implements control sequences such as dynamical decoupling. Such Gates are also beneficial because they are tailor-made for hardware-specific applications.

## Quantum Process Tomography 			

 Given a state-preparation circuit that prepares a system in a state, reconstructs a description of the density matrix ρ of the actual state obtained in the system.
We performed tomography on a 3 gate circuit involving, 3 qubits. 
We performed tomography on a noiseless simulator and obtained a fidelity of 0.9837737. 
A natural progression to the problem would be to perform tomography on a noise-based system and check its performance.
